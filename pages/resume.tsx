		Resume Tips

		The hiring manager will look at your resume for less than 20 seconds to decide whether they want to chat with you. You need to trim down your resume to highlight the information they are looking for: Accomplishments in previous software roles, years of experience in different technologies and your expertise. With that in mind, follow these tips to make a killer resume:

		Structure your resume to fit on one page - see template to help
		Remove all roles that are not in software
		If you are senior and your past jobs don’t fit on 1 page replace the oldest ones with: Previous experience at X and Y in B. Hiring managers really only care about your last 3 jobs.
		Stay on point: replace all paragraphs with 1 sentence
		Move your experience to the top of the page before education and other sections.
		Hiring managers do not read paragraphes, just have 1 line at the top of your resume saying what your expert in and what you’re looking for such as:
		Engineering Manager with 5+ years experience managing full stack teams. Looking for an Engineering Manager role in the Bay Area.

		Trim down your list of technologies to 3-4 so you appear to be an expert in them. If you add a lot of technologies the hiring manager will assume that you are not expert in any one of them but have a shallow understanding.

		Standardize your job titles:
		If you had a technical lead role, change the title to engineering manager if you had direct reports. Titles mean different things at different company but you should stick to the industry standards,

		For each role, highlight your accomplishments:
		Start with the impact of your work
		More revenue? Lower costs? More subscriptions? Happier customers? Efficiencies?
		Describe the work that resulted in impact
		Outline your role in doing the work
		Add a technology section below for every role and add the top 3 technology you worked in

		Example:

		Role - Company

		Led project to rebuild the registration flow to streamline signups and increased new user registrations by 5%.
		Mentored a team of 4 engineers on architecture and implementation
		Technologies: Python, React, AWS

		Outcome

		What?: Rebuild the registration flow to streamline signups
		Impact: Increased new user registrations by 5%.
		Your Role: Led the project with the help of 4 other engineers who I mentored
		Learnings:  Understanding of user conversion funnels
		Expertise: Python, React
